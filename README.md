## Grocery Helper
### By @Vince10041

Welcome to my side project :D

This application aims for users to mark down the prices, brands and timestamp of buying a single grocery. As a person who loves to shop in the wet market and do grocery shopping, I have created for myself to monitor the price change based on product name with data visualisation.
